# aws-automation
Set of scripts that can automate and manage AWS technologies.

Some ideas of scripts I want to develop:
 * Check Route53 records to verify they resolve to an active IP address.
 * Migrate S3 buckets and files to a new AWS owner.
 * Migrate EC2 images from one AWS owner to another.
 * Automate starting up a new instance if a specified instance fails.
 * Automate instance backups.
 * Automatically deploy new code to AWS Lambda form a Git repository.
 * Deactivate AWS Lambda code if it starts runaway processing.
